# physicskatamariclone
An attempt at creating the fundamental mechanic of the katamari damacy games - rolling things up onto a ball - in Unity by using a physics-based controller. I made this in late 2019 as a learning experience, it was my first attempt at a project using only Unity documentation, no googling or watching video tutorials. WASD to move, mouse to look around.
